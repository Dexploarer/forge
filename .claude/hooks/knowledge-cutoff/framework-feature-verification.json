Before using framework features:\n\n1. **Ask the user for their framework version**\n   \"What version of [framework] are you using?\"\n\n2. **Check for breaking changes since your cutoff:**\n   - React 19: New hooks, compiler changes\n   - Next.js 15: App router updates, server actions\n   - Vue 3.x: Composition API improvements\n   - Angular 17+: Signals, standalone components\n   - Django 5.x: Async updates, ORM changes\n   - TypeScript 5.x: New syntax, decorators\n\n3. **Verify current best practices:**\n   ```bash\n   # Check framework version in project\n   cat package.json | grep \"react\"\n   \n   # Use WebFetch to get latest docs\n   ```\n\n4. **Look for deprecation warnings:**\n   - Deprecated hooks/APIs\n   - Removed features\n   - New recommended patterns\n\n**Common issues:**\n- Using deprecated React APIs\n- Wrong Next.js routing approach\n- Outdated Vue syntax\n- Old Angular patterns\n\n**Ask before implementing:**\n\"I'm going to implement [feature] using [framework]. Since my knowledge\ncutoff is [date], should I verify the current best practices for your\nversion first?\"\n\nSee: .claude/rules/knowledge-cutoff-awareness.md for full protocol."
