Check the current version: npm view <package> version\n2. Review the changelog: npm view <package> readme\n3. Verify the API hasn't changed since your cutoff\n4. Check for breaking changes in recent versions\n5. Look for security advisories\n\nDo NOT assume the package API you know is still current.\nVerify first, then install.\n\nSee: .claude/rules/knowledge-cutoff-awareness.md for full protocol."
