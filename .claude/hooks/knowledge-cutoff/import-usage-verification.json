Verify the package's current export structure\n2. Check if the imports you're suggesting still exist\n3. Look for renamed or deprecated exports\n4. Verify TypeScript types if using @types packages\n\nPackage APIs change frequently. Verify before writing code.\n\nExample verification:\n```bash\nnpm view <package> version\nnpm view <package> readme\n# Or check the package's official documentation\n```\n\nSee: .claude/rules/knowledge-cutoff-awareness.md for full protocol."
